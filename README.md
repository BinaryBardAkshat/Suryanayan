# Suryanayan AI

Suryanayan AI is a project aimed at using drone technology and artificial intelligence for monitoring and detecting issues in solar panels. This project is inspired by the Indian government's initiative to promote solar energy by providing subsidies on solar panels.

## Introduction

In the wake of the Indian government's announcement regarding subsidies on solar panels, Suryanayan AI seeks to leverage drone-mounted cameras and machine learning algorithms to detect various issues such as bending, scratches, and broken panels in solar installations. The detected issues are then transmitted to a control room along with GPS coordinates for timely intervention and maintenance.
